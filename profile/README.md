At [Decentology](https://www.decentology.com/) we believe in making blockchain more accessible for mainstream users with the goal of making a better world. Together, we believe we can onboard the first 10 million developers to the blockchain.

We believe decentralized technology has the potential to help create a better, more equitable world where everyone has access to a decent quality of life. That equitable world starts with developers. It starts with the people who will explore, experiment, and build.
